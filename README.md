## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a way of making software where you use parts of code and data that can be reused. Those parts are called services, and it's like building blocks that do specific tasks for a business that they are made up of the things needed to run that task.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-These are the characteristics of Service-oriented architecture (SOA)

*Standardized Service Contracts - Services follow a description and use contracts to show what they do and what they're capable of. These contracts have info to help people understand and find the services easily. This info is kept in a service registry or profiles.

*Composability - Composability means making big tasks into smaller ones that work well together. Services should be good at what they do alone and be adaptable to different kinds of information for similar tasks.

*Interoperability - It means ensuring that different services can work together by using common standards or rules. This allows various users to access and utilize the service without any compatibility issues.

*Loose Coupling â€“ it aims to depend on each other less. They set up relationships to need less from one another by having clear limits and fewer connections in how they work and who uses them. The goal is to be more independent and not rely too much on each other to work well.

*Abstraction means hiding the complex stuff of how a service works from the outside. It keeps things simple and shows only what's important. By hiding extra and technical details, services only reveal what's needed for others to connect with them. This keeps their relationships flexible and less reliant, making services easy to use together without showing all the inner workings.

*Service Reusability - It's like taking a big system and breaking it into smaller parts that can be used in many situations. The idea is to make these parts really adaptable so they can be used in different places, not just one. Instead of making something that only works for one job, it's about making things that can be used in lots of ways, making the whole system more flexible and efficient.

*Autonomy - It means each service operates independently, controlling its own actions without heavy reliance on others. This independence boosts reliability and predictability in how the service behaves.

*Statelessness - It helps them grow and work better. By managing their 'state' in special ways, it makes their rules more flexible and easier to use again and again.

*Discoverability - is about making services easy to find, often in a service registry. It's really important for services to communicate well with each other. Instead of just being like interchangeable tools, services have their own identity and can be managed individually or in groups.

3. Define Microservices.
-Microservices are like smaller, separate parts of a system, unlike big, connected systems. They make applications more flexible and easier to work with. They allow for specific updates, using different tools for different jobs, and can grow individually, saving money. They're different from big, connected systems and another similar system called service-oriented architecture.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-Benefits of Microservices 
-Executives and project leaders really like microservices, which is kind of uncommon because usually, there are things are built is more for the engineers. But with microservices, it's different. They fit well with how leaders want to organize their teams and projects, making it easier to run things the way they prefer. Microservices are a way of building things that match the way operations are managed.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-The difference between SOA and microservices is their scope.
SOA was all about linking services across the entire company, connected services across the whole business while microservices focus on just one application. and are about breaking down one application into smaller, more flexible pieces.
They have different goals. SOA wants services to be reused across the enterprise, while microservices are more about making individual parts of an application independent. They also use different communication methods, SOA often uses synchronous communication, while microservices prefer asynchronous ways to talk to each other.
In SOA, the focus is on everyone using the same communication system, but with microservices, each part can have its own way to communicate. This can make SOA systems slower but more uniform, while microservices might be faster but less standardized. Both have their strengths, but they work differently and serve different scopes within a business.
